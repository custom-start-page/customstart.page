### New

- new start page:
    - [Ascii Start](https://ascii-start.customstart.page) ([repo](https://github.com/custom-start-page/ascii-start))
- you can now reset the settings on a startpage with a handy button

### Improved

- switched from using LocalStorage to store user settings to cookie storage so pages can be rendered by the server rather than on the frontend
- startpages no longer need to run Javascript to be custom (supported by using EJS)
- renamed Edit page to Settings
- fixed links on [Win95](https://ascii-start.customstart.page) so they don't open a new tab every time

### Coming up

I've been working on a tool which should help with developing new startpages called `custom-start-page-tool`.

You can checkout development here: https://github.com/custom-start-page/custom-start-page-tool
