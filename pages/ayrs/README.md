It's a startpage... with favs and feeds!

Pieced together from [GandaG/startpage](https://github.com/GandaG/startpage) and [Jaredk3nt/homepage](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/homepage).

### Usage

Using it with Firefox was a bit of work, so I have a guide [here](https://meain.io/blog/2019/set-local-file-as-newtabpage-in-firefox/) to help you out.

To switch themes change swap `--text-color` and `--bg-color` in `style.css`.

### TODO

- [ ] add option to toggle dark mode (save preference)
- [ ] add option to show read blogs
- [ ] add another button called `not my type` along with `mark read`
- [ ] let user add blog without having to editing the `constants.js` file
